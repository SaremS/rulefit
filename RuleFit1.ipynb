    "# RuleFit for interpretable Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While Deep Learning will probably keep its position as the hottest topic in Machine Learning for the nearer future, we also see a rising interest in white-box models whose calculations and outputs can be interpreted by a human being. Although it might look like this interpretability restrictions severely shrinkens the toolbox of usable algorithms there are still plentiful models that are both human readable and flexible enough for serious data analysis and prediction.  \n",
    "Some of the better known models that fulfill the requirements are for example [Polynomial Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression) or [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). There are also less well known options like [Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming), Bayesian Additive Regression Trees ([BART](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~edgeorge/Research_papers/BART%20June%2008.pdf)) or [Bayesian Treed Models](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~edgeorge/Research_papers/treed-models.pdf) of which all, due to their probabilistic construction schemes, require some more dedication to be trained properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post I want to look at the [RuleFit algorithm by Jerome Friedman](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~jhf/ftp/RuleFit.pdf) that is both interpretable and flexible and which I personally think is a real genius solution to the interpretability-accuracy trade-off that data analysts and scientists will encounter most of the time.  \n",
    "In short, the core idea of RuleFit is to train a series of diverse Decision Trees, extract all single decision rules from the trees into a matrix of binary dummy variables and run a (penalized) Linear Regression between the explained variable and the original features combined with the dummy matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is easiest explained through example so for the remainder I will reconstruct the RuleFit algorithm using sklearn's Decision Tree and Linear Model frameworks."

    "## How RuleFit works\n",
    "At first, RuleFit constructs a large amount of if-then rules via Decision Trees and then uses 1/0 dummy variables to mark if a given observation in fulfills that rule or not. Considering the first two rows in the table above, an example rule could state **if sqft_living<=1180 and floors<=1.0** and since row one fulfills that rule, the according dummy for that observation would be $1$, whereas the second row would be marked as $0$\n",
    "All dummy variables for all observations are then combined into a new dataframe together with the original features and regressed on the target variable ('price' in this example). Normally, a small subset of all rules will be sufficient to get good results, so a penalized version of Linear Regression like Lasso is used to filter out unnecessary rules.\n",

    "The .decision_path(X) method will create a binary matrix marking the nodes that each observation passed by applying the if-then rules in the tree. Notice how each observation passed the root-node (column \"0\" in the matrix), then the observation in row \"0\" passed node 1 (grade<=8.5) and ended up in node 2 (lat<=47.534) which is a leaf node.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "That way, every observation in the dataset receives 0/1-classifications based on the nodes it passed on its way through the tree. This indicates wether the sample matches the rules created by the tree or not. Notice that the .decision_path() method does not extract all possible rules from the tree but only the combined rules among the decision paths up to a given node. While there are more rules to extract, the current solution is much easier to implement and faster to run. Additionally, more rules can always be created by using an ensemble of trees and combining the resulting dummy-matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next comes the question about how to best create a whole lot of different rules. The main reason for applying RuleFit in the first place was to create an interpretable output, so for a human interactor it would be easiest if the rules were rather short. That means that we prefer shallow Decision Trees, which makes Gradient Boosting a good choice for RuleFit as it creates an ensemble of smaller trees. Nevertheless, all algorithms that generate lots of diverse Decision Trees work for RuleFit, even a simple for-loop of randomized (Extra) Decision Trees.  \n",
    "(I will spare the use of Tree Ensembles for rule creation until next time and continue with a single tree for simplicity)\n",
    "\n",
    "The final ingredient before running the Linear Model is to merge the dummy dataframe with the original features - that's because Decision Trees are having trouble to deal with highly linear data. Thus, adding the original features will enable the (linear) Regression Algorithm to fix that issue for RuleFit."
